### Allophony {#consonant-allophony}

Some stops have allophonic realisations (in free variation) that more clearly distinguish them from their aspirated/unaspirated counterparts:
- /p/ : [b]
- /ʈʰ/ : [ʈ͡ʂ]

Viil displays a high level of non-phonemic intervocalic lenition in its stops. True stop phones only exist either at the start of words, or as geminates.

The intervocalic realisations of all the stops are:

- /p/ : [β]
- /pʰ/ : [ɸ]
- /t/ : [d ~ z]
- /tʰ/ : [tʰ]
- /ʈ/ : [ɻ]
- /ʈʰ/ : [ʂ]
- /k/ : [ɣ]
- /kʰ/ : [x]
- /q/ : [ʁ ~ ʀ]
- /qʰ/ : [χ ~ ʀ̥]

### Consonant harmony {#consonant-harmony}

All lingual nasals and stops are subject to some kind of consonant harmony in Viil. There are two interacting consonant harmonies in the language --- dorsal and retroflex.

#### Retroflex harmony {#retroflex-harmony}

Viil's retroflex harmony is bidirectional, and only extends over a single vowel. That means that in the sequence A-v-B-v-R-v-C-v-D where v are any short vowels, R is a retroflex consonant, and A, B, C, and D are other consonants, R can only affect consonants B and C. However, if either of these consonants itself turns retroflex as a result of the harmony, this continues onwards until the next consonant isn't turned retroflex or the harmony is [blocked](#consonant-harmony-blocking).

Retroflex harmony turns /t/, /tʰ/, /k/, /kʰ/, /n/ and /ŋ/ into /ʈ/, /ʈʰ/, /q/, /qʰ/, /ɳ/ and /ɴ/ respectively.

#### Dorsal harmony {#dorsal-harmony}
Dorsal harmony is triggered by uvular consonantsViil's dorsal harmony is, unlike its retroflex one, asymmetrically bidirectional. It only extends over one vowel toward the beginning of the word, but extends indefinitely (until it is [blocked](#consonant-harmony-blocking)) in the direction toward the end of the word. The same repeating rule applies as with the dorsal harmony, so if the previous syllable's consonant is converted into a uvular one, it then also affects the one before it.

Dorsal harmony turns /k/, /kʰ/ and /ŋ/ into /q/, /qʰ/ and /ɴ/ respectively. Note that dorsal harmony does not affect alveolar consonants, so the relationship of these two harmonies is asymmetrical (retroflex harmony can trigger dorsal if it converts a velar consonant, but not the other way around).

#### Harmony blocking {#consonant-harmony-blocking}

All consonant harmony is blocked by labial stops and nasals, and by long vowels.
