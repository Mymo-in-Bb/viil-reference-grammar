# What is Viil?

Viil is my new conlang, spoken by a fictional culture of nomadic peoples around
the southern polar circle of a fictional world. 

Right now, the language is in the beginning stage of development, so there 
isn't much of anything yet. The language's aesthetics are strongly inspired by
Kalaallisut and similar languages, which can be seen in its phonology and the
fact that it's a polysynthetic language. This aesthetic is meant to change over
time as the language begins to develop its own character.

You can visit my [Tumblr blog](https://www.tumblr.com/viil-lang) where I try to
document my development of the language in a more chronological manner.

If you'd like to know more about my other language Kolic, whose speakers are in
semi-regular contact with speakers of Viil, you can check out the
[Kolic reference grammar](https://mymo-in-bb.github.io/kolic-reference-grammar/)
or the [Kolic Tumblr blog](https://www.tumblr.com/kolic).
